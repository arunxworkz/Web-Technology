    <h2>Operation of JVM</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Loading
            <p>The JVM starts by loading the .class files, which are the compiled Java bytecode.<br>
                These class files are loaded by the ClassLoader, which is responsible for loading classes into the JVM
                at runtime.<br>
                ClassLoaders can load classes from various sources (e.g., files, network, or other locations)..</p>
        </li>
        <li>Bytecode Verification
            <p>JVM will perform the byte code verification to check whether the bytecode is valis or not</p>
        </li>
        <li>Execution
            <p>JVM consistes of two primary appproaches for executing the byte code<br>
                Interpreter - It will translates the byte code line by line into machine code instruction<br>
                JIT - Let us conside an exapmle that a byte code is having an function which is invoked every now and
                then and
                here JIT will compile int into machine code and cached will execute it directly.This speeds up
                performance since the JVM does not have to interpret the same bytecode repeatedly.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
